# Unchained
Get all restaurants that aren't chains near me. Support local restaurants!
This is a small Java app that I whipped up in an effort to find better places to eat. My friends and I are tired of going to the same old chain restaurants again and again.
One day, we made an effort to find a restaurant that wasn't a chain that we would be interested to try...and we found the best wings shop in the metro Atlanta area!
This small app will hopefully enable people who have to endure the same first-world problems as I have had to endure to overcome.

HOW TO USE:
Run UnchainedTester.java (It's a CLI) and follow the on-screen instructions. A "Maps Query" is something like "5 miles left of Taco Mac Mall of GA"

I hope you enjoy! Stay Unchained!
